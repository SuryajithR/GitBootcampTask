3. Turn on Git Pages
4. Take a screenshot of your Hosted Website with your name in it and upload it in an image hosting site or Google Drive ( Be Sure to change Share Permission to allow anyone with the link to view )
5. Create a Pull Request with your Name as the PR Message and screenshot link as the description
